# Hi, I'm Noelle 👋

**Data Scientist & Data Analyst**

I turn messy data into clear answers. Whether it's building machine learning models or designing dashboards, I focus on delivering insights that actually move the needle for business goals. I believe the best solutions come from collaboration — blending technical rigor with the ability to explain what the data is really saying. If you're solving problems with data, I want to be part of that conversation.
